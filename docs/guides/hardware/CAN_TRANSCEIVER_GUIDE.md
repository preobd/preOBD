# CAN Transceiver Hardware Guide for preOBD

## Overview

**Critical requirement**: All CAN functionality in preOBD requires an external **CAN transceiver** to convert between logic-level signals (3.3V or 5V) and the differential CAN bus signals (CAN-H and CAN-L).

### Why You Need a Transceiver

Your microcontroller's CAN peripheral (FlexCAN, TWAI, or MCP2515) operates at **logic level** (TTL):
- Teensy/ESP32: 3.3V logic
- Arduino Mega/Uno: 5V logic

The physical CAN bus uses **differential signaling**:
- CAN-H (CAN High): Dominant ~3.5V, Recessive ~2.5V
- CAN-L (CAN Low): Dominant ~1.5V, Recessive ~2.5V
- Differential voltage: ~2V (dominant), ~0V (recessive)

**The transceiver bridges these incompatible voltage domains.** Without it, your microcontroller cannot communicate on the CAN bus.

### CAN Controller Abstraction

preOBD uses a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that supports multiple CAN controller types:

- **FlexCAN** (Teensy 3.6/4.0/4.1 native) - 2-3 CAN buses, high performance
- **TWAI** (ESP32/ESP32-S3 native) - 1 CAN bus, requires external transceiver
- **SPI** (External SPI-based controllers) - 1-2 buses, works on any platform with SPI
  - Currently supported: MCP2515
  - Future: MCP25625 (integrated transceiver), SJA1000
- **bxCAN** (STM32 native, planned) - 1-2 buses depending on variant

**Hybrid Mode** allows mixing controller types on different buses. For example:
- ESP32 TWAI (bus 0) + MCP2515 (bus 1) for dual-bus operation
- Teensy 4.1 with 3 FlexCAN buses + MCP2515 (bus 3) for a 4th bus

See [Build Configuration Guide](../configuration/BUILD_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md#hybrid-can-controller-mode) for hybrid mode setup.

### When Do You Need This?

You need a CAN transceiver for **any** CAN output use case:
- **RealDash over CAN** - Dashboard display on mobile/tablet
- **OBD-II scanners** - ELM327 Bluetooth adapters with Torque/OBD Fusion
- **Custom CAN devices** - Aftermarket gauges, data loggers, etc.

**Note**: RealDash can also work over Serial/UART/Bluetooth without CAN hardware. This guide only applies if you're using CAN output.

## Recommended CAN Transceivers

### For 5V Platforms (Arduino Mega, Uno, Nano)

| Chip | Voltage | Current | Availability | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **MCP2551** | 5V | 500kbps | Common, $1-2 | Industry standard, widely available |
| **TJA1050** | 5V | 1Mbps | Common, $2-3 | Automotive grade, NXP/Philips |
| **TJA1051** | 5V | 1Mbps | Common, $2-3 | Improved TJA1050 with slope control |

**Recommended module**: Generic MCP2551 breakout board (~$2-3 on eBay/AliExpress)

### For 3.3V Platforms (Teensy, ESP32, Due)

| Chip | Voltage | Current | Availability | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **SN65HVD230** | 3.3V | 1Mbps | Common, $2-3 | **Recommended** - TI automotive grade |
| **MCP2562** | 3.3V/5V | 1Mbps | Common, $2-4 | Dual voltage, more expensive |
| **TJA1042** | 3.3V/5V | 5Mbps | Less common | High-speed, overkill for preOBD |

**Recommended module**: Waveshare SN65HVD230 CAN Board (~$3-5)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Never use a 5V transceiver (MCP2551, TJA1050) directly with 3.3V platforms! The TX/RX pins are 5V and will **permanently damage** your microcontroller.

### Voltage Level Shifting Options

If you only have a 5V transceiver and a 3.3V platform:
1. **Best**: Buy a 3.3V transceiver (SN65HVD230) - safest, cleanest
2. **Acceptable**: Use a bi-directional logic level shifter between MCU and transceiver
3. **Not recommended**: Voltage divider on RX, direct connect TX (unreliable)

### Arduino Uno with MCP2515 + MCP2551

**Hardware**: Same as Mega, but limited RAM

```
Arduino Uno     MCP2515        MCP2551        Vehicle CAN Bus
-----------     --------       --------       ---------------

                                           →   120Ω termination
```

**Notes**:
- Same wiring as Mega
- **Limited features** due to 2KB RAM - use compile-time configuration only
- See [STATIC_BUILDS_GUIDE.md](../../advanced/STATIC_BUILDS_GUIDE.md)

### Multi-Bus and Hybrid Mode

**Multi-bus configurations** allow preOBD to communicate on multiple CAN buses simultaneously. This is useful for:
- Separating input (reading sensors via CAN) from output (sending data to displays)
- Interfacing with multiple vehicle networks (e.g., powertrain CAN + body CAN)
- Testing and development with isolated CAN buses

**Teensy 4.1 Dual FlexCAN Example:**
```
Teensy 4.1      SN65HVD230 #1  SN65HVD230 #2
-----------     -------------  -------------
Pin 22 (TX1) →  CTX (bus 0)
Pin 23 (RX1) ←  CRX (bus 0)
Pin 0 (TX2)  →                 CTX (bus 1)
Pin 1 (RX2)  ←                 CRX (bus 1)
3.3V         →  VCC            VCC
GND          →  GND            GND
                CANH/CANL →    Vehicle CAN Bus 0
                               CANH/CANL → Vehicle CAN Bus 1
```

**ESP32-S3 Hybrid Mode Example (TWAI + MCP2515):**
```
ESP32-S3        SN65HVD230     MCP2515        MCP2551
-----------     -------------  --------       --------
GPIO20 (TX) →   CTX (bus 0)
GPIO21 (RX) ←   CRX (bus 0)
GPIO10 (CS) →                  CS
GPIO11 (SCK)→                  SCK
GPIO12 (MISO)←                 SO
GPIO13 (MOSI)→                 SI
3.3V        →   VCC            VCC
GND         →   GND            GND
                CANH/CANL →    Vehicle CAN Bus 0
                               TX         →   TXD
                               RX         ←   RXD
                                              VCC (5V or 3.3V)
                                              GND
                                              CANH/CANL → Vehicle CAN Bus 1
```

**Configuration:**
- Pin assignments for SPI CAN controllers are in `src/config.h`
- Hybrid mode requires build flags in `platformio.ini`:
  ```ini
  -D ENABLE_CAN_HYBRID
  -D CAN_BUS_0_TYPE=CanControllerType::TWAI
  -D CAN_BUS_1_TYPE=CanControllerType::MCP2515
  ```
- Use pre-configured environments: `esp32s3_hybrid` or `teensy41_hybrid`

**Notes:**
- Each bus requires its own CAN transceiver
- Each bus should have 120Ω termination at both ends (if preOBD is at an end)
- Baud rates are configured per-bus via serial commands

## Connecting to Vehicle CAN Bus

### Option 1: OBD-II Port (Recommended for Testing)

Most modern vehicles have a standardized OBD-II connector under the dashboard.

**OBD-II Pinout (DLC connector)**:
```
      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
      9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

Pin 4:  Chassis ground
Pin 5:  Signal ground
Pin 6:  CAN-H (ISO 15765-4)
Pin 14: CAN-L (ISO 15765-4)
Pin 16: +12V battery power (unswitched)
```

**Wiring from transceiver to OBD-II**:
```
Transceiver CANH  → OBD-II Pin 6 (CAN-H)
Transceiver CANL  → OBD-II Pin 14 (CAN-L)
Transceiver GND   → OBD-II Pin 5 (Signal GND)
```

**Notes**:
- OBD-II CAN runs at **500 kbps** (preOBD default)
- Built-in 120Ω termination in vehicle ECU
- **Be careful**: Don't disrupt factory ECU communication!
- Use a Y-splitter if you have an existing OBD-II device plugged in

### Option 2: Direct Wiring (Permanent Installation)

For classic cars or custom installations without OBD-II.

**CAN bus wire colors** (no standard, verify with multimeter):
- Twisted pair: CAN-H and CAN-L (often yellow/green or orange/blue)
- Usually shielded cable for noise immunity

**Termination resistors**:
- CAN bus requires **120Ω resistors** at **both ends** of the bus
- preOBD is typically a node in the middle (no termination)
- If preOBD is at the end of the bus, add 120Ω between CAN-H and CAN-L

**Verifying termination**:
1. Disconnect all devices from bus
2. Measure resistance between CAN-H and CAN-L
3. Should read **~60Ω** (two 120Ω resistors in parallel)
4. If >100Ω, bus is under-terminated (add resistor)
5. If <50Ω, bus is over-terminated (remove resistor)

## Troubleshooting

### "CAN init failed" on Boot

**Symptoms**:
```
⚠ MCP2515 CAN init failed!
  -or-
⚠ ESP32 TWAI init failed!
```

**Possible causes**:
1. **No transceiver connected** - Check wiring
2. **Wrong voltage** - 5V transceiver on 3.3V platform
3. **Bad solder joints** - Reflow connections
4. **Incorrect CS/INT pins** - Verify config.h settings (MCP2515 only)
5. **Crystal mismatch** - MCP2515 module uses wrong crystal (8MHz vs 16MHz)

**Fix**:
- Double-check wiring against diagrams above
- Use multimeter to verify 3.3V/5V on transceiver VCC pin
- For MCP2515: Verify CS and INT pins match config.h

### No Communication on CAN Bus

**Symptoms**:
- CAN initializes successfully
- No errors in serial output
- RealDash/Torque shows "No connection" or "No data"

**Possible causes**:
1. **Missing termination resistors** - Bus needs 120Ω at both ends
2. **Wrong baud rate** - preOBD uses 500 kbps (standard)
3. **CAN-H/CAN-L swapped** - Try reversing wires
4. **Bus off state** - Too many errors, CAN controller shut down
5. **No transceiver power** - Check VCC on transceiver module

**Fix**:
- Measure resistance between CAN-H and CAN-L (~60Ω when properly terminated)
- Verify 500 kbps baud rate in receiving device (ELM327, RealDash, etc.)
- Swap CAN-H and CAN-L wires (polarity matters!)
- Power cycle preOBD to reset CAN controller
- Use multimeter to verify 3.3V or 5V on transceiver VCC pin

### Intermittent Communication / Random Errors

**Symptoms**:
- Communication works sometimes
- Errors increase with cable length
- Works when close, fails when far from ECU

**Possible causes**:
1. **Poor termination** - Incorrect resistor values
2. **Unshielded cable** - Noise from ignition, alternator, etc.
3. **Ground loops** - Different ground potentials
4. **Cable too long** - Exceeds max length for 500 kbps (~100m)
5. **Loose connections** - Vibration causing intermittent contact

**Fix**:
- Use proper 120Ω resistors (not 100Ω or 150Ω)
- Use **twisted pair** cable (CAN-H and CAN-L twisted together)
- Use **shielded** cable and ground shield at one end only
- Keep cable runs short (<10m ideal, <100m max at 500kbps)
- Use crimped or soldered connections, not breadboard jumpers

### 3.3V Transceiver on 5V Platform

**Symptoms**:
- Unreliable communication
- Transceiver gets warm/hot
- Works at short distances only

**Problem**:
5V microcontroller driving 3.3V transceiver can cause:
- Voltage stress on transceiver inputs
- Reduced noise margins
- Overheating

**Fix**:
- **Best**: Use 5V transceiver (MCP2551, TJA1050)
- **Acceptable**: Use dual-voltage transceiver (MCP2562, TJA1042)
- **Not recommended**: Add resistor divider on TX line (degrades signal integrity)

### 5V Transceiver on 3.3V Platform

**Symptoms**:
- **Microcontroller damaged immediately**
- Magic smoke released
- Board stops responding

**Problem**:
5V transceiver outputs 5V on RX pin → **destroys 3.3V GPIO**

**Fix**:
- **Immediately disconnect power**
- Microcontroller may be permanently damaged
- Replace with 3.3V transceiver (SN65HVD230)
- If repairing: Check if microcontroller still works after replacing transceiver
